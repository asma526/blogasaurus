    <p>I was born in Pakistan in 1999, where I lived for 2 years. My family moved to South Orange, NJ on Valentine's Day in 2001. I went to Clinton Elementary School for grade school then South Orange Middle School and Columbia High School. I am really excited to start college at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. I hope to major in Computer Engineering.</p>
